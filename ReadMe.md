## CairoSharp

CairoSharp is a .NET 8+ wrapper for [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/).

Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.
The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF.
Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering.
All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.).

## Platforms

[A former release](https://github.com/zwcloud/CairoSharp/releases/tag/dotnet45_v1) works on .NET Framework (Windows desktop, and Winform / WPF)
on .NET 4.5 and Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04) on Mono 4.2.
CairoSharp was ported to .NET Core (.NET Standard 1.6) after that release, and later on (in this repo) to move on it only supports .NET 8+.

Supported platforms:

* Windows 32bit / 64bit
* Linux 64bit (tested on Ubuntu 16.04-server)
* Linux Arm

Other platforms that support .NET may work, but have not been tested.

On Windows all dependencies are included.

On Linux _libcairo_ is a prerequisite. See https://www.cairographics.org/download/ on how to install.
Cairo version 1.17.2 is minimum.

The C# code files in CairoSharp project was taken from Mono / [GTK#](https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/tree/master/cairo)(Version 3.0.0), licensed under the GNU LGPL.
So CairoSharp uses LGPL as well.

I, @gfoidl, forked the repo from @zwcloud, made a lot of changes, which got then merged upstream by @zwcloud. Now for several years the upstream repo
from @zwcloud seems to be stale, so I made again a lot of changes in this fork here. At the time of this writing there's only very little in common with
the upstream repo -- it's a complete rewrite for modern .NET.

## Native libraries

https://gitlab.com/saiwp/cairo.git

https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html


From cairo repo https://gitlab.com/saiwp/cairo/-/blob/master/INSTALL:
x64:
```cmd
rem Run in "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"

cd native\cairo

meson setup --buildtype=release --default-library=both --default-both-libraries=shared -Dtests=disabled ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x64\build
ninja -C ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x64\build

rem build will likely not complete, but the desired artifact is there...
rem meson install -C ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x64\build --destdir ..\out
```
x86:
```cmd
rem Run in "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"

cd native\cairo

meson setup --buildtype=release --default-library=both --default-both-libraries=shared -Dtests=disabled ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x86\build
ninja -C ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x86\build

rem build will likely not complete, but the desired artifact is there...
rem meson install -C ..\..\artifacts\native\win-x86\build --destdir ..\out
```
