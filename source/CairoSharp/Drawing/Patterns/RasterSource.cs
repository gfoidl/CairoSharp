/// The raster source provides the ability to supply arbitrary pixel data whilst rendering.
/// The pixels are queried at the time of rasterisation by means of user callback functions,
/// allowing for the ultimate flexibility. For example, in handling compressed image sources,
/// you may keep a MRU cache of decompressed images and decompress sources on the fly and
/// discard old ones to conserve memory.
/// <para>
/// For the raster source to be effective, you must at least specify the acquire and release
/// callbacks which are used to retrieve the pixel data for the region of interest and demark
/// when it can be freed afterwards. Other callbacks are provided for when the pattern is copied
/// temporarily during rasterisation, or more permanently as a snapshot in order to keep the
