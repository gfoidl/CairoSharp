/// Recording Surfaces â€” Records all drawing operations

/// A recording surface is a surface that records all drawing operations at the highest level
/// of the surface backend interface, (that is, the level of paint, mask, stroke, fill, and
/// show_text_glyphs). The recording surface can then be "replayed" against any target
/// surface by using it as a source surface.
/// <para>
/// If you want to replay a surface so that the results in target will be identical to the results
/// that would have been obtained if the original operations applied to the recording surface had
/// instead been applied to the target surface, you can see the example code in
/// <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Recording-Surfaces.html">cairo docs</a>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A recording surface is logically unbounded, i.e. it has no implicit constraint on the size of the
/// drawing surface. However, in practice this is rarely useful as you wish to replay against a
/// particular target surface with known bounds. For this case, it is more efficient to specify the
/// target extents to the recording surface upon creation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The recording phase of the recording surface is careful to snapshot all necessary objects
/// (paths, patterns, etc.), in order to achieve accurate replay. The efficiency of the recording
/// surface could be improved by improving the implementation of snapshot for the various objects.
/// For example, it would be nice to have a copy-on-write implementation for _cairo_surface_snapshot.
