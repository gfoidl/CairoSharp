## Gtk4Demo

### Preface

For simplicity all code for a window is in the same file. In real world code it would -- of course -- be split into separate types and files.

In addition to the _cairo_ examples this demo is kind of a playground / learning resource for GTK 4 (for me to have a reference on how some basic stuff is done).

### MainWindow

This shows the [cairo examples](https://www.cairographics.org/samples/) with just a few little additions by me (like hit testing).

### PixelWindow

Shows how to render $z = f(x,y)$ with different color maps.
