## FreeType demo

### FreeType .NET library

Wrappers like [FreeTypeSharp](https://github.com/ryancheung/FreeTypeSharp) are pretty raw and near to the C-API, so there's no logic inside the wrapper.

Further the [FreeType API](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-face_creation.html) is well documented, thus no explicit wrapper is used in CairoSharp.

### Validation of the font file

https://fontdrop.info/ is quite handy.
